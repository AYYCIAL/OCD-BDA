本项目为OCD-BDA结构的实现代码
OCD-BDA分为三个部分：YOLOv8 Lite；R50M2Net；HGC
其中YOLOv8 Lite主要基于YOLOv8实现，因此不上传
HGC内需要嫁接YOLOv8 Lite，可根据注释实现
其余组件在代码内有详尽注释，虽然看起来杂乱，但是稍加整理后都可以使用
最终目的是实现目标级建筑损伤检测的三级分类

This project is the implementation code of OCD-BDA structure
OCD-BDA is divided into three parts: YOLOv8 Lite; R50M2Net；HGC
YOLOv8 Lite is mainly based on YOLOv8 implementation, so it is not uploaded
YOLOv8 Lite needs to be integrated into HGC, which can be implemented according to the comments
The rest of the components have detailed comments in the code, although they look messy, they can all be used after a little organization
The ultimate goal is to achieve three-level classification of target level building damage detection
